***Flask Application with Docker***

This project is a simple Flask web application that returns "Hello Team" when accessed via a web browser. The application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run in different environments. It also includes a .env file for environment configuration and a .gitignore file to avoid committing unnecessary files.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:
* Docker
* Python 3.x (for local development or testing)

Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get your Flask application running using Docker:

1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
```

2. Build the Docker image
Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile.
```bash
docker build -t flask-app .

```

3. Run the Docker container
Once the image is built, you can run the application in a Docker container. The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5001/:
```bash
docker run -p 5001:5001 flask-app

```

4. Access the Application
Once the container is running, visit http://localhost:5001/ in your browser. You should see the message:

***Hello Team***

requirements.txt
This file lists the dependencies required to run your Flask application. It typically includes Flask and any other libraries your app depends on.To install dependencies locally or in a Docker container, run:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

.gitignore
The .gitignore file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. Typically, this includes files that are automatically generated or contain sensitive information. Example contents of the .gitignore file:
```bash
*.pyc
__pycache__/
*.env
*.log
```

docker_with:
The  docker_with file contains environment-specific variables, which can be used to configure your application.

 Run the app locally
 ```bash
    python app.py

 ```

 Stop the Docker Container
To stop the running Docker container:
```bash
docker ps          # Find the container ID of the running container
docker stop <container-id>  # Stop the container

```

***Conclusion***

This project demonstrates how to build and containerize a simple Flask web application using Docker. It includes configuration for local development and environment management.
Feel free to modify the code or the Docker setup to fit your needs.
